# Branch & Price Template

This repository contains a structured template for a branch and price algorithm.
This allows for rapid testing and experimentation of your B&P ideas.

**The purpose is not for performance! The purpose is quick implementation for prototyping branch and price ideas!**

So copy or fork this repo, and apply it to your own problem by filling in the blank lines.

This repository is a work in progress, contributions are welcome.

For a more complete example on only branch and bound, see [my other repo](https://github.com/sandyspiers/branch_and_bound_template).
